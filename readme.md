### Idea

Amid the current pandemic outbreak, peoples are forced to stay home to break the chain of transmission. But there are some unfortunate people who don't have anyone at their home to rely for help or emotional support. And also there are some who have limited or no access to the internet at their home like in New Zealand. So here is a crowdsourcing phone support.

### Process

1. *John* make a phone call to the phone number.
2. *John* is added to a queue and wait.
3. The backend will ring everyone who set their status as available online.
4. *David* pick up his phone call. 
5. The backend will automatically connect his phone call to *John*, and drop other requested phone calls.

### Prerequisites
